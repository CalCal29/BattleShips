1. Learn node.js. I would like to use node.js in order to host servers for others to play against my battleship bot.
2. Create the user interface. For this section i would there to be selectable battle ships, these battle ships can be placed on the grid although they cannot over lay.
once cicked the battleship will stay in place on the grid. There will be a confirm button which locks in the battleships and updates the gird.

3. Next we be creating the bot. This bot will use the hunting algorithm, this algortihm is the most used for battleship Ai.
